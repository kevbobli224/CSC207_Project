# what is done:
- obstacle dodger has a scoreboard

# what needs to be done:
- fix the obstacle dodger bug
    - try again for the guest scoreboard allows the guest to replay
    continuously
- still need to refactor sliding tiles and ultimate tic tac toe
- need scoreboard and save scores to account for ultTTT
- fix layout for launch centre
- address FEEDBACK from phase 1
    - split up functionality in launchcenter
    - access scoreboard from game selection
    - Use the most abstract version of a class when declaring a field
    (see feedback)
    - authentication (checkingexistingaccount) could be offloaded to an
    authentication class for logging in and creating accounts.
    - also this comment: One thing to note is that typically android
    stores static strings inside a resource file, the reason they do
    this is 1. for organization, and 2. for localization (i.e. easy
    translations), obviously translations isn't something you need to
    worry about, but it's good practice to follow conventions."
        - referring to the hardcoded strings in the activity layout files
        for Scoreboard, Launch centre, etc.
- javadocs, unitests, design patterns etc.
