# Meeting 1: 2018/10/23
## Tasks completed during the meeting
* Set up the repository with Kevin's A2 files
* set up the team agreement contract

## Phase 1 Tasks (from Quercus)
Phase 1 (adding functionality to A2)
* Game launch centre:
    * Sign up/Sign in: Users should be able to sign up for an
        account and sign in to their accounts using a
        username/password.
    * Start new game
    * Load previously saved games
    * Any other relevant functionality you want to add (bonus)
* Scoreboard:
    * Come up with a scoring system for the game considering
    important factors (e.g., number of moves, time taken to finish
    the game). Then automatically calculate the score after the user
     finishes the game and store their score on the scoreboard. You
     should be able to implement and show per-game and per-user
     scoreboards. This scoreboard needs to get updated if the users
     finishes with higher scores.
* Autosave:
    * In addition to standard save functionality, the games should save
    automatically in specific intervals so the user doesnâ€™t lose
    progress if the phone restarts or is turned off.
* Undo:
    * The game should have an undo button so the user can undo
    their last n moves. The minimum number of moves the user should
    be able to undo should be set to 3 by default, but you could
    allow the user to change the number of steps as a bonus.
* Sliding tile puzzle game complexity:
    * The user should be able to
    choose the complexity of their sliding puzzle game by choosing
    the number of tiles. Currently, it is always 4x4 but they should
     be able to play 3x3 or 5x5 as well.
* Change background (bonus):
    * Use an image instead of numbered tiles. Allow the user to upload
    an image to use as the background for the tiles instead of using
    numbers. Doing this will change the objective of the game from
    arranging tiles to order numbers, to arranging tiles to assemble the
     correct image.

## Tasks to be completed
* fill out and complete the team agreement
* make a plan for how to complete the tasks for phase 1
* make README.md file
    * Will instruct the marker on how to run your program and describe
    the various functionalities you have implemented, and any other
    information we need to set up and run your code
